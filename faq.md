# How did *EularDAO* start?

*EularDAO* is inspired by [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) whose members have generally taken pride in displaying their achievements.

It would be interesting to issue [NFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token)s for solution providers because the [NFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token)s represents the intelligence, skills, and hard work put into the solution.

On-chain competiton is fair, auditable, and transparent, and it is a great way to share achievements in mathematics, algorithms, and coding skills, while protecting the copyright of the authors.

# Can I sell my [NFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-fungible_token)? 

Sure!

Your solution will belong to the buyer once you sell it.

# Can I plagiarize?

Yes.

Submitted solutions are public to everyone. The compiled solutions are all fetchable but not their source code if their authors didn't publish the source code.

The exact same solution cannot be submitted twice because the hash of the compiled code is locked once submitted. Of course, you can modify the solution a bit or just append some meaningless code to it and then submit it successfully.

The winner of a competiton is the lowest gas usage solution and if the gas usages for two solutions are the same, the earlier one will be chosen.

Thus, if other users plagiarize your solution, you are still earlier than them.

Also, a two-step submission mechanism is used to avoid plagiarism and [MEV](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-research).

# What can I do if a problem has a mistake?

Submit an issue on [Problems](https://github.com/EulerDAO/problems) and provide a test case. It's better to provide additional code in any language to prove your test case.

# Can I view other solutions before I solve a problem?

Sure, but you may lose the pleasure of solving the problems!

Submitted solutions are public to everyone and we are not willing or able to hide them.

# Where is my solution stored?

Solutions are recorded on blockchain, and if you use [ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) mainnet, your solutions may never been lost.

# Can I submit problems?

Sure and welcome!

If you have a wonderful idea, you are welcome to submit issues or pull requests on [Problems](https://github.com/EulerDAO/problems). DAO members will decide which problems to accept.

# Is there a forum for discussion?

A forum is not provided but you can still discuss under the issue of [Problems](https://github.com/EulerDAO/problems) and submit your solutions on [Solutions](https://github.com/EulerDAO/solutions) or verify your solution contract on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/).
